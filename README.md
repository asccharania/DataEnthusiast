Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Analysis Projects 

Here, you will find projects I have done throughout my career. The biggest influencer and contributor in my learning of ML algorithms was a online Udemy course by the name of "Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science" taught by  Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves and SuperDataScience Team.
